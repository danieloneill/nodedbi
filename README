LibDBI binding for NodeJS. Mostly complete, but of course contributions are much appreciated.

LibDBI and development headers are required.
On Debian or Ubuntu, apt-get install libdbi-dev.

Then run "node-gyp configure build" to build the module and "node-gyp install" to install it.

HTML documentation can be generated from the supplied markdown with mkdocs. Alternatively, see the wiki on Github.
